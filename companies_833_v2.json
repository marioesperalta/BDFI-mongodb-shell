Consumer Electronics &amp; Appliances Support information, Repair Service, Manuals &amp; Guides, Problems &amp; Solutions, Troubleshooting, FAQ&#8217;s History. </p>\n\n<p>Fixya was founded by an entrepreneur who decided to take advantage of the fact that consumer products manufacturers are not providing adequate support through their web sites. Although these products become more and more technologically advanced, their manufacturers are not allocating the necessary resources that are required in order to provide good technical support. Like any other consumer out there, Fixya&#8217;s founder had a hard time finding relevant and updated support information for his printer or digital camera, and therefore decided to create this site. The idea behind Fixya is to aggregate all support information that is scattered throughout the internet in a single user friendly location. </p>\n\n<p>In addition, Fixya is a huge knowledgebase that is constantly updated by a live community of users who share their experiences of technical problems and solutions. Through the site&#8217;s unique rating system, Fixya is allowing its users to find the best solution for every problem and even solve new problems. Over time, Fixya will offer the best solutions for the most common problems of each and every product that exist. </p>\n\n<p>The best thing about Fixya&#8217;s knowledgebase is that it&#8217;s based on real users&#8217; experience rather than on projected FAQs by the manufacturer. Website Users can get solutions to any issue with any consumer product by typing the name of the troublesome product or a brief description of their problem, and then clicking Search. Users can also browse lists of product manufacturers and recently posted problems. If users cannot find solution, they can click on ask button to post their question. Within hours they are other members within Fixya coming to rescue with a solution to the issue. The site also lets you search for repairmen in your area. </p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0000/0592/592v7-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0000/0592/592v7-max-250x250.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0000/0592/592v7-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Fixya","permalink":"fixya"}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder & CEO","person":{"first_name":"Yaniv","last_name":"Bensadon","permalink":"yaniv-bensadon"}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Yoav","last_name":"Shilon","permalink":"yoav-shilon"}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Member Of The Board Of Directors","person":{"first_name":"Raj","last_name":"Kapoor","permalink":"raj-kapoor"}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Board Member","person":{"first_name":"Rami","last_name":"Beracha","permalink":"rami-beracha"}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CIO","person":{"first_name":"Jonathan","last_name":"Cardella","permalink":"jonathan-cardella"}},{"is_past":true,"title":"VP Sales","person":{"first_name":"Ben","last_name":"Vincelette","permalink":"ben-vincelette"}},{"is_past":true,"title":"VP Product","person":{"first_name":"Yumio","last_name":"Saneyoshi","permalink":"yumio-saneyoshi"}},{"is_past":true,"title":"VP","person":{"first_name":"Yaniv","last_name":"Bar-Lev","permalink":"yaniv-bar-lev"}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Marketing Director","person":{"first_name":"Dana","last_name":"Oshiro","permalink":"dana-oshiro"}},{"is_past":true,"title":"VP R&D","person":{"first_name":"Lior","last_name":"Leiba","permalink":"lior-leiba"}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"Kluster","permalink":"kluster"}},{"competitor":{"name":"SuggestionBox.com","permalink":"suggestionbox"}},{"competitor":{"name":"PaidSupport.com","permalink":"paidsupport-com"}}],"providerships":[{"title":"Accounting","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Guberman","permalink":"guberman"}}],"total_money_raised":"$8M","funding_rounds":[{"id":1835,"round_code":"a","source_url":"http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/03/18/fixya-raises-6-million-b-round-for-crowdsourced-tech-support/","source_description":"TechCrunch","raised_amount":2000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":1,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Mayfield Fund","permalink":"mayfield-fund"},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Pitango Venture Capital","permalink":"pitango-venture-capital"},"person":null}]},{"id":1836,"round_code":"b","source_url":"http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/03/18/fixya-raises-6-million-b-round-for-crowdsourced-tech-support/","source_description":"TechCrunch","raised_amount":6000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2008,"funded_month":3,"funded_day":18,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Mayfield Fund","permalink":"mayfield-fund"},"person":null},{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Pitango Venture Capital","permalink":"pitango-venture-capital"},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"One Franklin Parkway","address2":"Building 910, Suite 110","zip_code":"94401","city":"San Mateo","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":37.566879,"longitude":-122.323895}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<div style=\"width:320px;\"><div style=\"background-color:#dedede;width:320px;text-align:center;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:10pt;padding-top:4px;padding-bottom:5px;margin:0;\"><a href=\"http://www.vator.tv/news/show/2012-01-01-bensadon-interview\" target=\"_blank\">See this video on <span style=\"color:#38538e;font-weight: bold;\">Vator</span><span style=\"color:#50a756;font-weight: bold;\">.tv</span>&nbsp;&raquo;</a></div><embed src=\"http://www.vator.tv/embed/vpembed.swf\" FlashVars=\"v=4589_bensadon-interview-4x3.flv&b=2&i=4589&o=embed&vp=1&l=http://www.vator.tv/news/show/2012-01-01-bensadon-interview\" allowScriptAccess=\"always\" allowFullScreen=\"true\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" width=\"320\" height=\"265\" pluginspage=\"http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\"></embed></div>","description":"<p>Vator.tv Interview</p>"}],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.vccafe.com/2009/12/04/global-from-day-one-two-can-win-in-the-market-for-online-technical-support/","title":""}],"partners":[],"opening_date":{"$date":"2015-05-05T16:03:17.191Z"}}

Millions of consumers are now sharing activities and opinions about local businesses. They are also expressing needs such as &#8220;I&#8217;m hungry&#8221;, &#8220;My car just broke down&#8221; and &#8220;Does anyone have a dentist to recommend?&#8221; We call this the &#8220;Needium&#8221; (the &#8220;need&#8221; medium). Local businesses would benefit from hearing the voice of the consumer and engaging with them but these activities are happening on many sites and can be hard to discover. In addition, small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) are extremely busy. Needium, created by Praized Media, harnesses these valuable local conversations by capturing and aggregating relevant local information found in millions of social media status updates and messages. This is the true evolution of word-of-mouth marketing. </p>\n\n<p>Introducing Needium (http://needium.com/), the social lead generation tool for SMBs. Needium monitors social media sources and detects business opportunities based on local user needs and life events. It also listens for merchant name mentions (reputation management). Needium aggregates and structures that information in a Web-based dashboard where merchants can log-in to easily join conversations (and more) without having to monitor all social media sites individually. Based on merchant information in our structured database, a series of pre-configured results are automatically created for them, using their location, categorization and some user social actions collected from publicly available social media activity streams.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, the Praized Media enterprise platform toolkit includes:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Local Activity Stream module</li>\n<li>Real-time Search module</li>\n<li>Local Questions &amp; Answers module</li>\n<li>Social Yellow Pages (merchant ratings/reviews platform)</li>\n<li>Editorial module (structure and connect existing local editorial content around places)</li>\n<li>Social media applications (Facebook, Twitter, etc.)</li>\n<li>Mobile</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Founded by a team of local search technology veterans and social media experts, Praized received funding from CSL Ventures (formerly Garage Technology Ventures Canada) in September 2007.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,140],"assets/images/resized/0001/6230/16230v4-max-150x150.png"],[[206,193],"assets/images/resized/0001/6230/16230v4-max-250x250.png"],[[206,193],"assets/images/resized/0001/6230/16230v4-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Praized Community Plugin for Wordpress","permalink":"praized-community-plugin-for-wordpress"},{"name":"Praized Community Plugin for Movable Type","permalink":"praized-community-plugin-for-movable-type"},{"name":"Praized API","permalink":"praized-api"},{"name":"Praized Core Platform","permalink":"praized-core-platform"},{"name":"Needium","permalink":"needium"}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Peter","last_name":"Diedrich","permalink":"peter-diedrich"}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Sylvain","last_name":"Carle","permalink":"sylvain-carle"}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Paul","last_name":"Dawalibi","permalink":"paul-dawalibi"}},{"is_past":true,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Harry","last_name":"Wakefield","permalink":"harry-wakefield"}},{"is_past":true,"title":"VP Product Management and Business Development - cofounder","person":{"first_name":"Sebastien","last_name":"Provencher","permalink":"sebastien-provencher"}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$1M","funding_rounds":[{"id":926,"round_code":"seed","source_url":"http://www.praized.com/blog/about/web-20-startup-praized-media-inc-secures-1000000-in-seed-funding/","source_description":null,"raised_amount":1000000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2007,"funded_month":9,"funded_day":1,"investments":[{"company":null,"financial_org":{"name":"Garage Technology Ventures Canada","permalink":"garage-technology-ventures-canada"},"person":null}]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Needium HQ","address1":"460 Ste-Catherine W. #402","address2":"","zip_code":"H3B1A7","city":"Montreal","state_code":null,"country_code":"CAN","latitude":45.5049305,"longitude":-73.5681635}],"milestones":[{"id":81,"description":"Praized prepares for launch, Announces partnerships with YellowBook, Yellow Pages Group, and Localeze.","stoned_year":2008,"stoned_month":6,"stoned_day":25,"source_url":"http://praizedmedia.com/en/press/releases/praized-media-powers-up-for-launch","source_text":"MONTREAL, Quebec — June 25, 2008 — Praized Media, Inc., the first distributed local search platform designed for social media, today announced strategic partnerships with leading local search providers, bringing the new company to the forefront of the local search industry.

The zoomable canvas makes it fun to explore ideas and the connections between them. The result: visually captivating presentations that lead your audience down a path of discovery.</p>\n\n<p>Prezi was officially launched in 2009 by co-founders Adam Somlai-Fischer, Peter Halacsy and Peter Arvai. </p>\n\n<p>Adam Somlai-Fischer is an internationally renowned architect and visual artist who has been working with zooming presentations since 2001. Adam found that a zoomable user interface (ZUI) enabled him to explore the &#8220;big picture&#8221; overview of a floor plan and then zoom into the detail of individual rooms. Because there was no commercially-available zooming presentation editor, each presentation had to be coded by hand. Audiences were wowed and approached Adam to discover what presentation software he used. A few persuaded him to give them access to his code. Finally, in 2007, Budapest University of Technology professor Peter Halacsy convinced Adam to develop an editor so that anyone could make zooming presentations. After creating a prototype, they recruited a business-minded entrepreneur, Peter Arvai, to join as CEO to help them build a product and a company. Prezi was launched in April 2009 from Budapest, leading to investments from TED Conferences and Sunstone Capital. The San Francisco office was established in November 2009.

Our solutions help advertisers drive targeted transactions and acquire customers either on a pay-per-click, pay-per-lead or pay-per-sale basis through various marketing channels.</p>\n\n<p>The Inuvo Platform is the data hub for all of our transactions, products and services. This solution gives advertisers the power to create and manage their own campaigns and provides web publishers with more effective ways to monetize their advertising inventory. In addition, strategic partners and web developers may customize their implementation and services through an application-programming interface (&#8220;API&#8221;).</p>\n\n<p>We make our products smarter by learning from data.</p>\n\n<p>An important component of our business is the data produced by our advertisers and publishers as they drive targeted transactions. This is where we see which products convert and which websites attract viewers. This business intelligence helps us improve both the detection of fraudulent transactions and the response rates across all of our marketing channels.</p>\n\n<p>Inuvo is committed to providing only the best quality traffic to our customers. We are constantly improving our products with enhancements, such as proven click-fraud technology which eliminates bad traffic, transaction flagging within the Inuvo Platform to quickly evaluate questionable conversions, and targeting of advertisements based on behavioral information.</p>\n\n<p>Innovate isn&#8217;t just part of our name, it&#8217;s what we do.</p>\n\n<p>We use the Inuvo Platform as a foundation to provide additional monetization opportunities to our clients. As we drive targeted transactions through the Inuvo Platform and various Inuvo web properties, we have also developed applications that allow our customers to customize and expand their website user experience with useful services such as local business search, comparison shopping and customer &#8220;deals.&#8221; All of these services help our clients deliver a customized user experience which, in turn, drives transactions.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,59],"assets/images/resized/0003/2025/32025v8-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,98],"assets/images/resized/0003/2025/32025v8-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,177],"assets/images/resized/0003/2025/32025v8-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"BargainMatch.com","permalink":"bargainmatch-com"},{"name":"Yellowise.com","permalink":"yellowise-com"},{"name":"BabyToBee.com","permalink":"babytobee-com"},{"name":"ValidClick.com","permalink":"validclick-com"},{"name":"LocalXML.com","permalink":"localxml-com"},{"name":"Inuvo Platform","permalink":"inuvo-platform"},{"name":"Kidzadu.com","permalink":"kidzadu-com"},{"name":"www.Kidzadu.com","permalink":"www-kidzadu-com"}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Board Chairman","person":{"first_name":"Richard","last_name":"Howe","permalink":"richard-howe"}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Craig","last_name":"Dillon","permalink":"craig-dillon"}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CFO","person":{"first_name":"Wally","last_name":"Ruiz","permalink":"wally-ruiz"}},{"is_past":false,"title":"SVP, Exchange","person":{"first_name":"Jeremy","last_name":"Chrysler","permalink":"jeremy-chrysler"}},{"is_past":false,"title":"SVP Bus.

Our solutions help advertisers drive targeted transactions and acquire customers either on a pay-per-click, pay-per-lead or pay-per-sale basis through various marketing channels.</p>\n\n<p>The Inuvo Platform is the data hub for all of our transactions, products and services. This solution gives advertisers the power to create and manage their own campaigns and provides web publishers with more effective ways to monetize their advertising inventory. In addition, strategic partners and web developers may customize their implementation and services through an application-programming interface (&#8220;API&#8221;).</p>\n\n<p>We make our products smarter by learning from data.</p>\n\n<p>An important component of our business is the data produced by our advertisers and publishers as they drive targeted transactions. This is where we see which products convert and which websites attract viewers. This business intelligence helps us improve both the detection of fraudulent transactions and the response rates across all of our marketing channels.</p>\n\n<p>Inuvo is committed to providing only the best quality traffic to our customers. We are constantly improving our products with enhancements, such as proven click-fraud technology which eliminates bad traffic, transaction flagging within the Inuvo Platform to quickly evaluate questionable conversions, and targeting of advertisements based on behavioral information.</p>\n\n<p>Innovate isn&#8217;t just part of our name, it&#8217;s what we do.</p>\n\n<p>We use the Inuvo Platform as a foundation to provide additional monetization opportunities to our clients. As we drive targeted transactions through the Inuvo Platform and various Inuvo web properties, we have also developed applications that allow our customers to customize and expand their website user experience with useful services such as local business search, comparison shopping and customer &#8220;deals.&#8221; All of these services help our clients deliver a customized user experience which, in turn, drives transactions.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,59],"assets/images/resized/0003/2025/32025v8-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,98],"assets/images/resized/0003/2025/32025v8-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,177],"assets/images/resized/0003/2025/32025v8-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"BargainMatch.com","permalink":"bargainmatch-com"},{"name":"Yellowise.com","permalink":"yellowise-com"},{"name":"BabyToBee.com","permalink":"babytobee-com"},{"name":"ValidClick.com","permalink":"validclick-com"},{"name":"LocalXML.com","permalink":"localxml-com"},{"name":"Inuvo Platform","permalink":"inuvo-platform"},{"name":"Kidzadu.com","permalink":"kidzadu-com"},{"name":"www.Kidzadu.com","permalink":"www-kidzadu-com"}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Board Chairman","person":{"first_name":"Richard","last_name":"Howe","permalink":"richard-howe"}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CTO","person":{"first_name":"Craig","last_name":"Dillon","permalink":"craig-dillon"}},{"is_past":false,"title":"CFO","person":{"first_name":"Wally","last_name":"Ruiz","permalink":"wally-ruiz"}},{"is_past":false,"title":"SVP, Exchange","person":{"first_name":"Jeremy","last_name":"Chrysler","permalink":"jeremy-chrysler"}},{"is_past":false,"title":"SVP Bus.

Baveo supports mobile posting so that parents can update their Baveo site from their cellular phones.

Parents simply select the merchants with which they are registered and a link to the site conveniently appears on their personal Baveo site. Baveo currently offers baby registries from twelve leading retailers. </p>\n\n<p>The most common question asked of expecting parents is: â€œWhen is the baby due?â€ To help answer this question, Baveo provides a delivery date countdown.

The group dining experience is made memorable for the diners through fat savings on the check amount!

On GroupTable, diners book restaurant deals on a per-table rather than on a per-coupon basis. The dining experience is also enriched and made seamless by not requiring any printed coupons. The discount is offered on the whole bill value, irrespective of how many people eat at the table. Diner-host is sure to feel more power in the wallet! </p>\n\n<p>There are many other unique features in the model innovated by GroupTable. One such is “One Lucky Group a Day’ promotion under which the first group to book for the day at a restaurant enjoys steep discount. This generates buzz for the restaurant. All the negatives of a daily deal model have been addressed. The dining experience is made memorable for the diner-group.

The company uses the latest web technology, in conjunction with its own professional negotiators, to help its customers quickly find the right used car, without the negotiating hassle, at a desirable price. Unlike autotrader.com, or any other online used car service, Carsala works exclusively for buyers to save them money, hassle and time on their used car research and purchase. </p>\n\n<p>Carsala uses its own proprietary technology to automatically search more than 5 million car listings and works to find clients the best value for their preferred used car. The companyâ€™s extensive vetting process, which includes CARFAX reports, as well as its employeesâ€™ own insights based on more than one hundred years of auto industry experience, works to ensure that the customer is buying a reliable vehicle. In addition, Carsala helps its customers avoid the time-consuming and often frustrating process of researching and negotiating with the dealer to buy a used car.</p>\n\n<p>Carsala asks for a modest fee to research, check, and negotiate the best price on several used car options. If the customer decides to go ahead with a purchase, Carsala will charge 15 percent of the savings off the Kelly Blue Book suggested retail value, minus the research fee. Carsala guarantees that its negotiators can find the very best deal on any used car and will waive its research fee if a customer can find a better deal on any comparable, advertised, pre-owned automobile.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,56],"assets/images/resized/0002/9750/29750v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,93],"assets/images/resized/0002/9750/29750v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,168],"assets/images/resized/0002/9750/29750v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Tyler","last_name":"Elliston","permalink":"tyler-elliston"}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Raif","last_name":"Barbaros","permalink":"raif-barbaros"}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Headquarters","address1":"2140 Shattuck Avenue","address2":"#302","zip_code":"94704","city":"Berkeley","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":37.870457,"longitude":-122.268354}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[],"partners":[],"opening_date":{"$date":"2015-08-19T14:05:39.616Z"}}

Save me time searching through comments and recommendations and just post visual suggestions under my requests; the exact picture and link of the product being suggested.</p>\n\n<p>How many times you feel that you know what your need is, but don&#8217;t know what specific product or model you should buy? Like me you might have been in a situation where you know that you need a backpack or camera, but what model or brand to pick, you&#8217;ve no idea. So like most of us you either google or go to review sites to read all the comments and recommendations left by other users. You can search through page after page hoping for that golden suggestion.</p>\n\n<p>Wouldn&#8217;t it be nice if you put your request for what you are looking for with your personal requirements of price range, color etc., and next time you see suggestions right under your request. But suggestions are not just comments but visual pictures of suggestions and with links where you can buy them. Now that&#8217;s a real time saving, non-ambiguous help appreciated especially by non-techies.</p>\n\n<p>What does product do?</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Friendly interface to easily post requests and receive visual suggestions.</li>\n<li>Users can search products, create Wish lists</li>\n<li>Add products from external sites to your list and suggest products to user queries.</li>\n<li>Rate suggestions: Friendly interface to rate member suggestions (digg style) for a request, indicating in their view which suggestion matches the requested needs.</li>\n<li>Suggestion Gurus: If a requester feels that someone has made a great suggestion, he/she can award suggestion stars. This determines who becomes a suggestion guru in a particular category.</li>\n<li>Social networking - connect with like minded people and make friends. Mini feed to follow your friends or suggestion gurus.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>iShopWiser (founded by ex-telecom engineer) is a social shopping community that harnesses the power of social networking to bring answers to users shopping questions.</p>\n\n<p>How is it different from other social shopping sites?\nNo need to search through comments, reviews and recommendations to guess what product might work for you.

The marketer can log on to see what errors have come up, and then set up â€œrulesâ€ as to where the visitor should be redirected to.  The marketer can save even more time by subscribing to a personal RSS feed so he/she knows exactly when a new error has been logged.

They see the difficulty that homeowners have trying to find affordable help for a variety of household/yard services such as renovations, cleaning, yard work, painting, lifting materials, etc. Yardworkerz was created to bring these two groups of people from the community together more easily.

With record numbers of people being laid off, the skills required to survive unexpected unemployment have changed. The job market is flooded with highly qualified people and the competition for newly opening jobs is greater than ever. Couple this with the fact that many companies are continuously eliminating positions, the prospect of rapidly finding a new job is unlikely.</p>\n\n<p>This website was created as a way to unite displaced workers. By combining the accumulated knowledge of many people that have survived, or are currently surviving without a job, the Layoff Support Network is becoming an invaluable resource.</p>\n\n<p>Where this website differs from any other on the web is that its founders are real experts in surviving unexpected unemployment. The Layoff Support Network team is made up of people that have expertise in several different areas related to living after a layoff. The advice and support given by members of the LSN as well as the LSN team are being done so on a volunteer basis. Guest columnists have not been compensated (though guest columnists are allowed to put in a plug for their own businesses at the end of their articles). All submitted articles are screened for their relevancy in value to this site. You will not see any articles that are really advertisements in disguise.</p>\n\n<p>The goals of The Layoff Support Network are simple. We hope that as you experience issues, problems and emotions caused by unexpected unemployment you will come to this website and seek the advice and comfort of people that are feeling the same way. Remember, you are not in this alone. There are hundreds of thousands of other people experiencing similar things.</p>\n\n<p>Another goal of the LSN is to help you find a new job. Over the upcoming weeks we will be posting articles written by employment professionals to help you with your job search.</p>\n\n<p>Please come back to the Layoff Support Network whenever you need help, advice or are feeling alone.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[73,73],"assets/images/resized/0003/8376/38376v2-max-150x150.png"],[[73,73],"assets/images/resized/0003/8376/38376v2-max-250x250.png"],[[73,73],"assets/images/resized/0003/8376/38376v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[],"partners":[],"opening_date":{"$date":"2014-05-12T01:52:15.869Z"}}

They can preview how the telegram will look complete with old typewriter fonts, and it even inserts the word &#8220;STOP&#8221; where ever you use a period &#8220;.&#8221; like telegrams from the old days. The service then will dispatch via post an authentic classic style telegram and envelope for a very reasonable price, from any country to any country.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;Telegrams have become historical documents to mark important events like the first flight by the Wright Brothers. Most people who remember receiving telegrams enjoyed the warm glow it brought them for messages of thanks and congratulations—we just wanted to bring that experience back but use the power of the web to make the whole process fast, easy and inexpensive. We also wanted to use great design of the telegram and envelope itself to offer something unique and different that you don&#8217;t get with your traditional greeting card,&#8221; say the co-founders of the service.</p>\n\n<p>The service has been expanded to allow for discounted bulk sending of telegrams to many recipients for purposes of save the date, wedding and party invitations, or for corporate events. Additionally clients can upload photo&#8217;s that get printed and sent with their telegram to enhance the experience.</p>\n\n<p>For users of TechCrunch we are offering a 20% off discount to the service for a single telegram, to try it out - simply enter Promotion Code: TECH97</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[128,128],"assets/images/resized/0003/9082/39082v5-max-150x150.jpg"],[[128,128],"assets/images/resized/0003/9082/39082v5-max-250x250.jpg"],[[128,128],"assets/images/resized/0003/9082/39082v5-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"Traditional Classic Telegram","permalink":"traditional-classic-telegram"}],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Mark","last_name":"Sehler","permalink":"mark-sehler"}},{"is_past":false,"title":"co-founder","person":{"first_name":"Ranjan","last_name":"Tharmakalusingham","permalink":"ranjan-tharmakalusingham"}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"HQ","address1":"Stop 268 Victoria Rd  VIC 3071","address2":"","zip_code":"VIC 3071","city":"Thornbury","state_code":null,"country_code":"AUS","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,126],"assets/images/resized/0003/9080/39080v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,211],"assets/images/resized/0003/9080/39080v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,379],"assets/images/resized/0003/9080/39080v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,133],"assets/images/resized/0003/9081/39081v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,223],"assets/images/resized/0003/9081/39081v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,401],"assets/images/resized/0003/9081/39081v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[],"partners":[],"opening_date":{"$date":"2014-06-18T05:20:17.769Z"}}

Furthermore, we believe that a superior information and communication network has traditionally provided a distinct competitive advantage for Wall Street traders, as compared to independent traders on &#8216;Main Street.&#8217;</p>\n\n<p>MarketFriends seeks to narrow that information and communication gap. As the retail trading community grows larger, it becomes a much greater force in the financial markets. Knowing what the retail trading community is doing is becoming an increasingly important priority for all traders. We are that community! Our network of independent traders across the globe provides the framework for better informed, and thus, more profitable trading.</p>\n\n<p>The vast reach of the MarketFriends community increases the depth and breadth of information available to independent traders. From doctors to carpenters to housewives, we are a diverse network of people from all walks of life.

This can apply to as many email accounts as the user wishes to add to their profile.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally users can manage through a series of group rules how much of their personal details friends / colleagues / the public can see.</p>\n\n<p>A Handle will always be located @myhandle.com so when you&#8217;re asked what your Handle is, the suffix will eventually become redundant.</p>\n\n<p>In effect a user can meet someone new and simply say my Handle&#8217;s Johnny and then that persons email will be directed to the users designated public email (i.e. their GMail).

The company’s antivirals potentially address limitations in treating chronic HBV infection, a disease for which the only class of oral drugs available, polymerase inhibitors, are rarely curative and often require lifelong treatment, as well as in chronic HIV infection, a disease for which the continued ability of the virus to mutate inevitably leads to drug-resistant viral strains.

Unlike others, Wowd covers the entire web â€“ any publically available page, from any web site, anywhere, can potentially be included in the Wowd index.</p>\n\n<p>Like reference search engines, Wowd performs indexing and ranking of search resultsâ€¦ but it does so in a way that takes into account pages preferred by real users.  Wowd does not use crawlers that mindlessly follow links, filling an index with material that real people would never look at.  Wowd finds and ranks information according to the preferences and interests of real humans.</p>\n\n<p>Members of the Wowd user community, the â€œWowd Crowdâ€, determine web page popularity. Traditional search ranking methods are based on how pages link to each other, and this approach has been thoroughly gamed by web site publishers seeking search engine optimization.  People are much better at finding good web pages and avoiding bad ones than computer programs will ever be.  So Wowd taps into this human judgment and gives higher ranking to the pages people choose to visit.</p>\n\n<p>Wowd users nominate public pages for inclusion in the index just by visiting them.  When a Wowd Crowd member visits a public web page, it is automatically nominated, and the page is immediately added to the index.  No explicit voting or manual voting is required.</p>\n\n<p>The Wowd Crowd is surfing the web twenty-four hours a day, automatically nominating new public web pages for inclusion in the index.  A new page is made available to all Wowd Crowd members just seconds after only one of them finds it.  Thus, Wowd provides a real-time index that spans the entire scope of the human-readable public web.</p>\n\n<p>Wowd delivers search results that real people find interesting.  Wowd achieves both comprehensive coverage of the entire web and real-time performance through an innovative, distributed cloud architecture. </p>\n\n<p>Other real-time search engines achieve timeliness at the expense of comprehensiveness.  These services typically index just a handful of sites.  In contrast, Wowd delivers real-time results from the entire web, including all social media sites, all news sites, all blog sites&#8230; in fact, all public sites can be included in the Wowd index, provided they are nominated by a member of the Wowd Crowd.</p>\n\n<p>Wowd delivers popular and timely information in three ways: (1) a real-time Wowd Hot List of popular web pages that updates live before your eyes; (2) ability to search for specific items and sort results according to popularity or freshness; (3) ability search your own previously visited pages, making it extremely easy to find those pages again.</p>\n\n<p>Wowd is a real-time search engine that helps you discover whatâ€™s popular on the web right now.  Wowdâ€™s unique approach is to run as a web browser application, eliminating the need to share personal information with centralized servers.  Wowd protects your privacy.  Wowd does not collect personally identifiable information and does not share your search history or browsing history with anyone, including Wowd, Inc.</p>\n\n<p>In summary, Wowd is a great way to find out what real people are talking about, right now, on the web.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,52],"assets/images/resized/0004/1613/41613v7-max-150x150.png"],[[250,87],"assets/images/resized/0004/1613/41613v7-max-250x250.png"],[[294,103],"assets/images/resized/0004/1613/41613v7-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Mark","last_name":"Drummond","permalink":"mark-drummond"}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder, CTO, VP of Search","person":{"first_name":"Boris","last_name":"Agapiev","permalink":"boris-agapiev"}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Board of Directors","person":{"first_name":"Vince","last_name":"Vannelli","permalink":"vince-vannelli"}},{"is_past":true,"title":"VP of Product Development","person":{"first_name":"Bill","last_name":"York","permalink":"bill-york"}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Board of Directors","person":{"first_name":"Steve","last_name":"Jurvetson","permalink":"steve-jurvetson"}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Advisory Board","person":{"first_name":"Jonathan","last_name":"Ewert","permalink":"jonathan-ewert"}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"OneRiot","permalink":"oneriot"}},{"competitor":{"name":"TweetMeme","permalink":"tweetmeme"}},{"competitor":{"name":"Collecta","permalink":"collecta"}},{"competitor":{"name":"FAROO","permalink":"faroo"}},{"competitor":{"name":"JustSpotted","permalink":"justspotted"}},{"competitor":{"name":"Topsy Labs","permalink":"topsy-labs"}},{"competitor":{"name":"Crosspollinate","permalink":"crosspollinate"}}],"providerships":[{"title":"Marketing & Strategy","is_past":false,"provider":{"name":"Catalyst SF","permalink":"catalyst-sf"}}],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Palo Alto Office","address1":"261 Hamilton Ave. Suite 208","address2":"","zip_code":"94301","city":"Palo Alto","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":37.448598,"longitude":-122.158497}],"milestones":[{"id":4842,"description":"Wowd Announces Internetâ€™s First Personalized, Real-Time Tag Cloud Offering An\r\nImmediate View of the Webâ€™s Most Popular Topics Related to a Userâ€™s Search","stoned_year":2010,"stoned_month":2,"stoned_day":11,"source_url":"http://www.wowd.com/publications/public-beta-press-release-02112010.pdf","source_text":null,"source_description":"Wowd Announces Internetâ€™s First Personalized, Real-Time Tag Cloud Offering An","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Wowd","permalink":"wowd"}},{"id":4843,"description":"Wowd Users Can Now Get Web-Wide, Live Updates in Eleven Categories Including News,\r\nEntertainment, Technology and More","stoned_year":2010,"stoned_month":4,"stoned_day":14,"source_url":"http://www.wowd.com/publications/public-beta-press-release-04072010.pdf","source_text":null,"source_description":"Real-Time Search Engine Wowd Now Gives Users Category-Specific Hot Lists","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"Wowd","permalink":"wowd"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://twitter.com/wowd","title":"Twitter"},{"external_url":"http://www.facebook.com/wowd","title":"Facebook"},{"external_url":"http://blog.wowd.com","title":"Blog"},{"external_url":"http://distributedsearch.blogspot.com","title":"CTO's Blog"},{"external_url":"http://www.youtube.com/user/wowdadmin","title":"YouTube"},{"external_url":"http://www.slideshare.net/wowd","title":"Slideshare"}],"partners":[],"opening_date":{"$date":"2018-03-22T00:44:16.446Z"}}

Users can begin with a free basic AlertFox account. Pricing for PRO accounts starts at only $49/month. All AlertFox accounts include transaction monitoring support and global monitoring stations.</p>\n\n<p>As the shape and face of the internet continue to evolve, it is becoming increasingly apparent that yesterdayâ€™s solutions are no match for todayâ€™s challenges. Outdated website monitoring services claim to alert owners to problems, yet even when they give the all-clear signal and indicate that a website is up and running, there can be serious problems that hinder or event prevent visitors from performing common tasks. With todayâ€™s complex web applications, a web server can be &#8220;up,&#8221; yet still not be working correctly due to a bug in the script, backend code, database or the Flash and Silverlight applets. That is precisely why todayâ€™s web applications cannot be monitored with yesterdayâ€™s website monitoring services. They need the next-generation website monitoring services that, until now, were unavailable.</p>\n\n<p>AlertFox, a revolutionary new website monitoring service currently being offered as a beta version, aims to change all that. AlertFox is an in-depth monitoring service for Web 2.0 and SaaS web applications. Unlike its predecessors that are stuck in a Web 1.0 mindset, only AlertFox can monitor the function and performance of sites that are based on any of the major rich internet applications (RIA), including ActiveX, AJAX, Flash, Flex, complex HTML and Silverlight technology. AlertFox also helps SaaS users monitor their providerâ€™s reliability. As the first service that can monitor web applications with Flash and Silverlight applets, AlertFox is able to monitor sites like YouTube or Google Docs that previously were not candidates for these types of services. Furthermore, this monitoring runs directly in the web browser, thereby monitoring the true user experience.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,52],"assets/images/resized/0004/2468/42468v5-max-150x150.png"],[[239,84],"assets/images/resized/0004/2468/42468v5-max-250x250.png"],[[239,84],"assets/images/resized/0004/2468/42468v5-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Founder","person":{"first_name":"Mathias","last_name":"Roth","permalink":"mathias-roth"}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Head, Customer Support","person":{"first_name":"Tom","last_name":"Dimarco","permalink":"tom-dimarco"}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"AlertSite","permalink":"alertsite"}},{"competitor":{"name":"Gomez, Inc.","permalink":"gomez-inc"}},{"competitor":{"name":"Pingdom","permalink":"pingdom"}},{"competitor":{"name":"Keynote Systems","permalink":"keynote-systems"}},{"competitor":{"name":"WatchMouse","permalink":"watchmouse"}},{"competitor":{"name":"Neustar (formerly BrowserMob)","permalink":"browsermob"}},{"competitor":{"name":"Monitis","permalink":"monitis"}},{"competitor":{"name":"Catchpoint","permalink":"catchpoint"}},{"competitor":{"name":"PingMate","permalink":"pingmate"}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"Postfach 1343","address2":"","zip_code":"69184","city":"Walldorf/Heidelberg","state_code":null,"country_code":"DEU","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[{"id":8897,"description":"AlertFox Premiers Worldâ€™s First Monitoring Service\r\nwith Google Chrome Support at TechCrunch Disrupt SF.","stoned_year":2010,"stoned_month":9,"stoned_day":28,"source_url":"http://www.alertfox.com/press/","source_text":null,"source_description":"AlertFox Premiers Google Chrome Support","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"AlertFox","permalink":"alertfox"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,80],"assets/images/resized/0010/4572/104572v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,133],"assets/images/resized/0010/4572/104572v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,240],"assets/images/resized/0010/4572/104572v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[],"partners":[],"opening_date":{"$date":"2020-12-18T05:53:53.808Z"}}

You can think of us as an eHarmony for nonprofits and skilled volunteers.</p>\n\n<p>We are a for-profit social mission business, and we&#8217;re also a certified B-Corporation.</p>\n\n<p>What we do</p>\n\n<p>Catchafire helps nonprofits express their needs as short-term, discrete, and individual-based projects.</p>\n\n<p>We package our projects in this way to create off-the-shelf solutions for basic nonprofit needs and to make it easy for professionals to find time to volunteer in the midst of their busy daily lives.</p>\n\n<p>Nonprofits and professionals are matched to each other based on skills, cause interests, and time availability, among other characteristics.</p>\n\n<p>You&#8217;ve probably noticed that we&#8217;ve rolled out a select number of projects in the areas of marketing + communications. If you don&#8217;t see a project that fits you yet, don&#8217;t fret. We&#8217;re bringing projects that suit your skills soon. Let us know what you&#8217;d like to see. We&#8217;re here to listen and serve you.</p>\n\n<p>Why we do what we do</p>\n\n<p>We believe that a good volunteer experience can transform someone&#8217;s life, and we also know that a bad one can turn someone away from giving their time forever.</p>\n\n<p>Over the past five years the volunteer rate in America has dropped. In 2005 it was at nearly 29% and last year it was under 27%.</p>\n\n<p>We think the volunteer rate is falling because volunteer experiences don&#8217;t always make the best use of a volunteer&#8217;s time. We want to change this.</p>\n\n<p>It really kills us to know that almost $50 billion is left on the table every year because volunteers aren&#8217;t able to give their skills. We want to change this.</p>\n\n<p>Catchafire&#8217;s mission is to increase the quality of the volunteer experience for both the nonprofit and the volunteer by providing the opportunity for people to volunteer their skills in a meaningful way.</p>\n\n<p>We believe in providing efficient and effective volunteer experiences.</p>\n\n<p>Why we charge nonprofits</p>\n\n<p>Nonprofits pay us to match them with the right skilled volunteer to address their needs. In return, nonprofits receive professional services whose value far exceeds that of the match fee.</p>\n\n<p>On a philosophical level, we believe that by charging nonprofits they will place a higher value on our volunteers&#8217; time, which will increase the quality of the volunteer experience. It&#8217;s simple logic â€“ people and organizations value what they pay for, and we want our nonprofits to value our volunteers&#8217; time.</p>\n\n<p>Our service is free to volunteers, they are the ones who are giving their time after all.</p>\n\n<p>Our Story</p>\n\n<p>Rachael Chong was a successful young investment banker looking for a way to give back to her community in a meaningful way. One day, her firm offered a volunteer opportunity to help build a house in the Bronx. As Rachael&#8217;s five-foot two-inch frame hauled lumber across the schoolyard, she realized that she wasn&#8217;t volunteering in the most effective way. So she spent the next six months looking for a better way to volunteer her time. Rachael was shocked at the lack of opportunities to give her hard-earned skills. Frustrated by her inability to serve the greater good while juggling a demanding career, Rachael left the corporate world for the nonprofit world.</p>\n\n<p>A couple years later, Rachael was tasked with the challenge to help start up the US affiliate of BRAC, one of the largest nonprofit organizations in the world. To accomplish this daunting task with limited staff and a limited budget, Rachael had to think of inventive ways to use her resources. She turned to her network of friends and former colleagues, getting each to volunteer their time and expertise on short-term, discrete and individual projects. In this way, Rachael helped to free up the time of BRAC USA&#8217;s full-time staff to raise millions of dollars in the organization&#8217;s first year.</p>\n\n<p>Fresh off her success with BRAC USA, Rachael founded Catchafire with the goal to make it easy for every professional to give their skills (without having to quit their well-paying jobs) and to make it easy for every nonprofit to leverage the goodwill of professionals.</p>\n\n<p>Awards and Recognition</p>\n\n<p>*Selected Company, Investors&#8217; Circle, Spring 2010\n*Fellow, West Coast Village Capital, 2010\n*Winner, Duke University Start-Up Challenge Social Enterprise Track, 2009\n*Selected Company, InSITE, 2009\n*Second Place, DFJ Gotham East Coast Venture Challenge, 2009\n*Finalist, New York City Entrepreneur, 2009\n*Semifinalist, Dell Social Innovation Competition, 2009</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,49],"assets/images/resized/0037/2755/372755v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,82],"assets/images/resized/0037/2755/372755v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[257,85],"assets/images/resized/0037/2755/372755v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO & Founder","person":{"first_name":"Rachael","last_name":"Chong","permalink":"rachael-chong"}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP of Operations, Marketing Lead","person":{"first_name":"Scot","last_name":"Smith","permalink":"scot-smith"}},{"is_past":false,"title":"VP of Strategic Partnerships","person":{"first_name":"Mary","last_name":"Telesco","permalink":"mary-telesco"}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$400k","funding_rounds":[{"id":57367,"round_code":"partial","source_url":"http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1464350/000146435010000001/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml","source_description":"SEC","raised_amount":399984,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2010,"funded_month":5,"funded_day":20,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"31 East 32nd Street","address2":"","zip_code":"10016","city":"New York","state_code":null,"country_code":"USA","latitude":40.746417,"longitude":-73.983171}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[],"external_links":[],"partners":[],"opening_date":{"$date":"2013-01-07T07:28:39.776Z"}}

The initial products are a range of smart pigments and inks which can change colour when exposed to a variety of gases or UV light. The main focus of our initial products is in the food packaging industry, whereby the colour changing indicators can warn when food is past its best by undergoing a dramatic and distinct colour change. The patented smart pigments can be easily incorporated into plastic food packaging, creating colour changing plastic film which will help minimise food wastage and ensure consumers know when food is fit for consumption.

If you have a great gift idea, we would love to hear it!

KnowEm will not only help you secure your name across the vast social media landscape but we can also show you how to contact each site in order to have the name released and returned to you.</p>\n\n<p>To date the KnowEm team has helped to reserve over 500,000 profiles and reported back to some of our clients over 65,000 issues of squatting and misrepresentation of a brand, username or trademarked term. This is all done with local employees in New Jersey; we are proud to be a company fully staffed in the United States with absolutely no dependance on offshore outsourcing. Since security is one of our primary concerns, none of your sensitive information is sent overseas.</p>\n\n<p>Since April of 2009 KnowEm has been tracking and monitoring hundreds of social media networks populated mostly with user-generated content. Our database of networks is updated frequently as new sites are released and our staff reviews them for quality. We track multiple metrics on these sites to determine which networks are gaining (or losing) traction in the world of social media. By using and storing these metrics we watch for patterns and spikes in traffic and popularity.</p>\n\n<p>KnowEm also constantly updates and adds new sites to our vast database of social sites. The next Facebook, Twitter or MySpace is already out there or could be coming soon - do you know which one it will be? KnowEm offers a subscription service (Brand Protection Program) to ensure that you and your brand will not have to worry about it. As new sites emerge we will make sure that your flag is already planted and you will not have to worry about dealing with a squatter or someone who is misrepresenting your social media identity.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,34],"assets/images/resized/0004/4063/44063v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,57],"assets/images/resized/0004/4063/44063v2-max-250x250.png"],[[307,70],"assets/images/resized/0004/4063/44063v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Michael","last_name":"Streko","permalink":"michael-streko"}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder","person":{"first_name":"Barry","last_name":"Wise","permalink":"barry-wise-2"}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Advisor","person":{"first_name":"Brian","last_name":"Solis","permalink":"brian-solis"}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Creative Advisor","person":{"first_name":"Matthew","last_name":"Inman","permalink":"matthew-inman"}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Advisor","person":{"first_name":"Paige","last_name":"Craig","permalink":"paige-craig"}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Advisor","person":{"first_name":"Robert","last_name":"Siciliano","permalink":"robert-siciliano"}}],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"Main Office","address1":"Phoenix Ave","address2":"","zip_code":"07960","city":"Morristown","state_code":"NJ","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[{"id":3509,"description":"Startup KnowEm, which helps both large companies and small businesses stake their brand claim in social media landscape and manage their presence on these sites, has recently acquired FriendsCall.Me, a similar service, for an undisclosed amount.","stoned_year":2010,"stoned_month":1,"stoned_day":21,"source_url":"http://www.techcrunch.com/2010/01/21/social-media-identity-startup-knowem-acquires-friendscall-me/","source_text":null,"source_description":"KnowEm Acquires Rival FriendsCall.Me","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"KnowEm","permalink":"knowem"}},{"id":7575,"description":"KnowEm integrates full domain searching into username searching.","stoned_year":2010,"stoned_month":8,"stoned_day":18,"source_url":"http://knowem.com/blog/2010/08/17/knowem-announces-domain-name-availability-checking/","source_text":null,"source_description":"KnowEm Announces Domain Name Availability Checking","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"KnowEm","permalink":"knowem"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[{"embed_code":"<iframe width=\"480\" height=\"360\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/bTABSjnxGZ0?rel=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","description":"<p>How to Create a Public Profile on KnowEm</p>"}],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,72],"assets/images/resized/0006/3230/63230v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,121],"assets/images/resized/0006/3230/63230v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,218],"assets/images/resized/0006/3230/63230v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[150,123],"assets/images/resized/0019/5709/195709v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,206],"assets/images/resized/0019/5709/195709v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,371],"assets/images/resized/0019/5709/195709v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,518480,00.html","title":"'Twitterjacking' -- Identity Theft in 140 Characters or Less"},{"external_url":"http://voices.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2009/04/planting_your_flag_at_social_n.html","title":"Planting Your Flag at Social Networking Sites"},{"external_url":"http://news.cnet.com/8301-17939_109-10223183-2.html","title":"KnowEm searches 120 sites for open user names"},{"external_url":"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704471504574445502831219412.html","title":"Social-Media Con Game "},{"external_url":"http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2009-10-11/hollywoods-twitter-economy/2/","title":" Hollywood's Twitter Economy"},{"external_url":"http://www.cnn.com/2010/TECH/03/01/tiger.woods.online.image/index.html","title":"How Tiger Woods can rebuild his image online"},{"external_url":"http://blogs.wsj.com/hire-education/2010/06/25/manage-your-online-reputation%E2%80%94before-someone-else-does/","title":"Manage Your Online Reputationâ€”Before Someone Else Does"},{"external_url":"https://cms.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/?cmd=_render-content&content_ID=brc/creating_your_social_media_plan_part_one","title":"PayPal: \"Creating your Social Media Plan\""},{"external_url":"http://www.business2community.com/branding/advanced-brand-management-with-knowem-0209853","title":"Advanced Brand Management with KnowEm "}],"partners":[],"opening_date":{"$date":"2015-04-11T06:05:15.483Z"}}

itself well.\r\n\r\nWith a frenzy of activity surrounding location-based services, more and more startups are launching ideas that rely heavily on location. But implementing location is still a relatively complicated process. And thatâ€™s where SimpleGeo comes in.\r\n\r\nWeâ€™ve written about the service a number of times over the past several months. Basically, they provide the infrastructure and tools to allow other services to add location elements with ease. In fact, since they launched in beta late last year, they already have some 5,000 developers on board using their service. And tomorrow at the Where 2.0 conference in San Jose, CA, theyâ€™re opening up their platform for all to use.\r\n\r\nAlongside the launch, SimpleGeo is introducing two new products: the SimpleGeo Marketplace and the SimpleGeo Storage Engine. The Marketplace will make it easy for developers to see a range of different geodata and pick what they want to use. This store allows developers to get in touch with the geodata providers who are serving up the data (names you know like Twitter, Foursquare, Gowalla, etc).\r\n\r\nThe Storage Engine is a cloud-based system to allow developers to store location and do queries on it. Think of it as Amazon S3 for geodata.\r\n\r\nSo how much does it cost to use SimpleGeo? Itâ€™s free for up to a million calls, after that itâ€™s $399 for 2 million calls (and additional support), $2,499 for 10 million calls, and $9,999 for 30 million calls. The pricing model is based on how much youâ€™d need to pay for an engineer to handle that much data. Seeing as SimpleGeo curates this data and provides the servers needed for it, it will be a big value to most companies.\r\n\r\nDeCarta, ESRI, Localeze, MetaCarta, Quova, Stamen Design, and Weather Decision Technologies are a few of the big partnerships SimpleGeo recently signed. There was also a Skyhook Wireless deal that went live during SXSW. And youâ€™ve probably heard of some of the startups already using SimpleGeo, such as StickyBits and BumpRadar.\r\n\r\nSince its $1.5 million seed funding in November, SimpleGeo has been hiring like crazy and hopes to open a San Francisco branch soon (theyâ€™re currently based in Boulder, CO).\r\n\r\nAnd despite the launch, SimpleGeoâ€™s work is far from done. The plan is to launch a couple new features in relative short order, co-founder Matt Galligan tells us. One is called â€œPushpinâ€ which will let developers send in a coordinate and get back all sorts of data from SimpleGeo such as country, state, city, neighborhood, zip code, etc. And using other data, you could get the names of buildings on college campuses, for example, Galligan says.\r\n\r\nAnother new feature called â€œPolygonâ€ will let developers send in the name of an area such as â€œThe Missionâ€ in San Francisco, and SimpleGeo will return a list of everything in that area.\r\n\r\nLook for SimpleGeoâ€™s new website and new admin interface to launch tomorrow after Galligan takes at Where 2.0 around noon PT. Youâ€™ll be able to sign up to get in on the location action at that time. Then you can go build your own version of this","source_description":"Tomorrow, SimpleGeo Launches Into Location Orbit With 5,000 Partners In Tow ","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"SimpleGeo","permalink":"simplegeo"}},{"id":7650,"description":"SimpleGeo named in Lead411's Hottest Colorado Companies list","stoned_year":2010,"stoned_month":8,"stoned_day":17,"source_url":"http://www.lead411.com/colorado-companies.html","source_text":null,"source_description":" Lead411 launches \"Hottest Colorado Companies\" list","stoneable_type":"Company","stoned_value":null,"stoned_value_type":null,"stoned_acquirer":null,"stoneable":{"name":"SimpleGeo","permalink":"simplegeo"}}],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,85],"assets/images/resized/0010/0390/100390v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,142],"assets/images/resized/0010/0390/100390v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,255],"assets/images/resized/0010/0390/100390v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},{"available_sizes":[[[119,150],"assets/images/resized/0011/3741/113741v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[199,250],"assets/images/resized/0011/3741/113741v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[359,450],"assets/images/resized/0011/3741/113741v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://ideamensch.com/matt-galligan/","title":"Ideamensch.com Interview"}],"partners":[],"opening_date":{"$date":"2020-02-05T02:14:41.731Z"}}

If this model succeeds, it can fundamentally shift the power in the news business from the publishing companies to the individual editors/authors/experts and can encourage quality journalism. expertnews.me also bridges the gap between &#8220;professional&#8221; journalists and &#8220;amateur&#8221; bloggers - you are either an &#8220;expert&#8221; for your topics or you are not based on your stories and not based on your pay check.  </p>\n\n<p>expertnews uses a facebook-style feed-view to show users the news that are most relevant to them. Users can customize their feed by following experts (i.e. a single person from a newspaper or a complete blog) from the expert directory with a single click on &#8220;follow&#8221; or by adding their own experts. expertnews.me uses both the RSS-feed and twitter of the expert as data sources (more data sources (facebook, &#8230;) can be also be added later). </p>\n\n<p>Main Features in overview:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Follow news in a simple feed format (which you are used to from facebook)</li>\n<li>Discover the best an most important sources/experts for your topics in the expert directory</li>\n<li>Compile expert teams around specific topics (e.g. Hamburg or iphone development) and share them</li>\n<li>Share and comment your stories easily via facebook and/or twitter</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Since expertnews.me has the technology to take out single experts/authors from a complete newspaper RSS-feeds, authors/experts/editors get more bargaining power: Users no longer &#8220;buy the newspaper&#8221; - they follow individual editors who they trust in specific topics. Users can be their own &#8220;publishing house&#8221; and compile their own editorial staff. If authors/experts change their employer, they will take their &#8220;followers&#8221; with them. Therefore since individual authors are more visible and rewarded by earning followers, quality journalism is encouraged. </p>\n\n<p>In short: expertnews.me combines the best of twitter, RSS and a rated experts/authors directory. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>simplicity from twitter: follow experts by simply clicking on &#8220;follow&#8221; (easier than copy+paste RSS link)</li>\n<li>rich data from google reader: Having pictures and a few more lines of text is nicer than a shortened url on twitter</li>\n<li>&#8220;qype for authors/experts&#8221;: find the most relevant experts for your topics</li>\n<li>social graph from twitter and facebook: no need to establish new &#8220;friendships&#8221;.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>just go to expertnews.me to check out an early alpha version</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,81],"assets/images/resized/0004/5388/45388v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,136],"assets/images/resized/0004/5388/45388v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,245],"assets/images/resized/0004/5388/45388v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"expertnews.me","permalink":"expertnews-me"}],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"","address2":"","zip_code":"20146","city":"Hamburg","state_code":null,"country_code":"DEU","latitude":53.5688101,"longitude":9.9819779}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,88],"assets/images/resized/0004/5387/45387v2-max-150x150.png"],[[250,148],"assets/images/resized/0004/5387/45387v2-max-250x250.png"],[[450,266],"assets/images/resized/0004/5387/45387v2-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[],"partners":[],"opening_date":{"$date":"2016-01-08T05:23:05.278Z"}}

Knowing a one-size-fits-all approach does not work, Their products have the flexibility to adapt to your individual needs.\nTheir focus is on designing user-friendly web applications that solve the myriad of problems encountered by students, teachers, parents, and school administrators. Every day, teachers face challenges in classroom management, lesson planning, attendance and grading, event planning, and communication. Students and parents face some of the same problems, but from a different perspective.\nWith the launch of GPA Teacher, an online solution for educators at all levels, they have successfully incorporated many crucial applications into a single lightweight package. GPA Teacher provides a comprehensive set of classroom management tools, including seating charts, automated grade books and grade-related statistics, lesson and assignment planners, attendance and discipline records, and so on. To facilitate communication with parents and students, GPA Teacher interfaces with GPA Parent and GPA Student, providing transparent access in a secure environment.\nIn 2009, they embarked on their latest project, a complete solution for schools called GPA Network. GPA Network includes GPA Teacher, GPA Student, and GPA Parent, as well as GPA Administrator for school officials responsible for managing school and district-wide student information. Key to GPA Administrator is the ability to generate reports and analyze statistics using many slices of the data.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,114],"assets/images/resized/0004/5708/45708v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,190],"assets/images/resized/0004/5708/45708v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,343],"assets/images/resized/0004/5708/45708v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[{"name":"GPA Teacher","permalink":"gpa-teacher"},{"name":"GPA Network","permalink":"gpa-network"}],"relationships":[],"competitions":[],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$0","funding_rounds":[],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"gpa software inc","address1":"p o box 881731","address2":"","zip_code":"90009","city":"los angles","state_code":"CA","country_code":"USA","latitude":null,"longitude":null}],"milestones":[{"id":2379,"description":"Generating Report Cards\r\nFor the last few weeks, many teachers started requesting changes to our report cards, especially since for many teachers the first quarter ends soon, and parent-teacher conferences begin this week.

Quirky’s community members, inventors and product “influencers,” ultimately share its financial success with them. Headquartered in New York City, Quirky brings game-changing products to the marketplace through interaction between its active online global community and Quirky’s expert product design staff, bringing to life ideas from their earliest stages to store shelves.</p>\n\n<p>Quirky was founded in 2009 by Ben Kaufman, who is also the company’s CEO. Quirky is Kaufman’s third entrepreneurial venture. He previously founded Mophie and Kluster. Kaufman founded Quirky on the belief that ordinary people have extraordinary ideas, and that invention should be accessible to everyone. </p>\n\n<p>Any of Quirky’s community members can become an inventor or influencer by submitting ideas and helping to determine which products Quirky will design, manufacture, and sell. Inventors who submit ideas that are then created and influencers who contribute to those ideas share in royalties based on product sales. </p>\n\n<p>The company solicits ideas for new products via Quirky.com and its iPhone app. Once an idea is submitted, the Quirky community vets it, praises it, critiques it, and votes for their favorites, many of which will eventually be made by the Quirky design team and sold online and in stores.</p>\n\n<p>A prospective inventor can submit an idea to Quirky, and there is no limit on the number of invention ideas that a person can submit. When determining which products to make, Quirky considers factors such as uniqueness, manufacturing complexity, and intellectual property rights, yet they are committed to working on ideas both big and small that make life better.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,150],"assets/images/resized/0004/6233/46233v13-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0004/6233/46233v13-max-250x250.jpg"],[[250,250],"assets/images/resized/0004/6233/46233v13-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"CEO","person":{"first_name":"Ben","last_name":"Kaufman","permalink":"ben-kaufman"}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief

In other words, FinestExpert.com was created to help real estate investors find properties that feature the best financial profiles, not necessarily properties with the prettiest decorator touches. </p>\n\n<p>As the real estate market resets, savvy investors are finding tremendous opportunities throughout the United States, and billions of dollars will be made by these investors on home rentals in the coming months and years. But billions could also be lost; lost to poor investment decisions based on &#8220;gut feelings&#8221; or inaccurate data and forecasts. That&#8217;s why FinestExpert.com was developed - to take the guesswork out of rental property selection, and to put the power of sophisticated investment analysis into the hands of everyday investors with the wisdom and insight to recognize truly generational opportunity when it knocks. </p>\n\n<p>FinestExpert.com integrates the latest investment inventory data with truly revolutionary financial analysis software to create a one-stop tool for making important investment decisions. The FE-Score provided for each property takes literally thousands and investment factors, analyzes and weights each of them for relative importance, and produces a single number indicating projected investment quality. Think of the FE-Score as a &#8220;credit score&#8221; for investment properties, enabling fast, highly-reliable comparisons of investment properties without going through the drudgery of pencil-and-paper or spreadsheet analyses. </p>\n\n<p>FinestExpert.com exists to make it easier for you to make sound investment decisions, and to get to the best properties while other investors are still crunching numbers.  Search for great deals on Denver real estate and Florida real estate and Las Vegas real estate all at the same time - because FinestExpert&#8217;s unique cashflow search engine lets you search by what really matters - the property financials.

VistaGen’s drug rescue activities combine its human pluripotent stem cell technology platform, Human Clinical Trials in a Test Tube™, with modern medicinal chemistry to generate novel, safer chemical variants (Drug Rescue Variants) of once-promising small molecule drug candidates. These are drug candidates discontinued by pharmaceutical companies, the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) or university laboratories, after substantial investment in discovery and development, due to heart or liver toxicity or metabolism issues. VistaGen uses its pluripotent stem cell technology to generate early indications, or predictions, of how humans will ultimately respond to new drug candidates before they are ever tested in humans, bringing human biology to the front end of the drug development process.</p>\n\n<p>VistaGen’s small molecule prodrug candidate, AV-101, has completed Phase 1 development for treatment of neuropathic pain.

Since then, ipadio has developed a number of services based on its core technology including their flagship ContactEngine for customer interactions, FieldTalk for workforce engagement, and HDMobileVideo for next generation video sharing.</p>\n\n<p>As well as millions of users around the globe, ipadio works with multinational corporations, UK Government departments and worldwide charities.  Ipadio technology is used in a broad range of industry sectors including: telecommunications, engineering, education, gaming, healthcare, household services, media, pharmaceutical, retail, sport and transport.</p>\n\n<p>Technology:\nipadio has combined the power of the Internet with the flexibility and reach of the telephony network.  The consequent cloud-hosted communications servers allow for the easy collection and distribution of any kind of digital content, be that audio, video, image or text.  ipadio makes its technology available to corporates via Software as a Service.<br/>\nipadio also makes its audio and video broadcasting services available to users around the globe via either smartphone / tablet apps, via standard telephony, or via satellite telephony.</p>\n\n<p>Software as a Service: </p>\n\n<p>ContactEngine: ipadio’s flagship service, ContactEngine is for large-scale daily customer communications.   ContactEngine uses a combination of the following ipadio services to achieve up to 100% customer contact;</p>\n\n<p>InteractiveTxt – like internet chat, but via text message.  It’s an easy light touch way to have a brief but detailed conversation with a customer.  The messages are automatically personalised, with each message dependent on the response to the previous one.  Customers can easily respond even when they’re at work or travelling. </p>\n\n<p>VoiceForms – a form you fill in, by voice.  It’s a bit like IVR, but less annoying, since the questions are pre-set to the individual, who are taken on their own personal route with no irritating menus to select from.  </p>\n\n<p>Apps – the latest addition to the customer service arsenal, ipadio consider it just another communications channel: alerts from your company pop up on customer’s tablets or smartphones just as they do from LinkedIn or Facebook.  </p>\n\n<p>Email – you’ll be familiar with that!</p>\n\n<p>ContactEngine is configurable to switch between the channels depending on the urgency of the contact requirement, the time of day, and any other business rules that need applying.  ContactEngine deals with wrong numbers and multiple phone numbers, duplicates and multi-day calling schedules, and a host of other complex daily communication challenges.  And of course there’s an online admin and email or text alerting for the admin staff and management.</p>\n\n<p>FieldTalk: One of our most popular services for Internal Communicators, it provides easy 2-way communication between multiple-layers of management &amp; staff without interrupting work schedules.</p>\n\n<p>EBrief: It’s like web conferencing, but without the high cost, hassle, or internet bandwidth requirements, so it’s ideal for mass engagement with customers, between staff and executives, or for monthly team updates.  A great way to engage thousands of people simultaneously.</p>\n\n<p>HDMobileVideo: ipadio’s Apple and Android apps gather and distribute every sort of content (video, audio, phone, text, images) securely and on-brand.</p>\n\n<p>History:\nipadio’s core broadcasting technology was first used on November 1st 2008 via satellite phone from the mid-Atlantic, during the Transat Classique Lagasse race on a yacht called Infanta.  The name ipadio comes from Internet Protocol Radio – though the technology has come rather a long way since. </p>\n\n<p>2009: iphone app used globally for broadcasting audio, for example from the World Transplant Games on the Gold Coast of Australia.  Cross posting to social networks provided, along with embedded VoiceToText.  API developed. 2010:  Oxfam provide first broadcasts from Haitian Earthquake, and a number of charities such as The Red Cross, Amnesty International, and Great Ormond Street for Children and the Duke of Edinburgh’s Award start using ipadio as part of the broadcasting and fundraising mix.  Several Sports bodies such as the English Golf Union, the British Horseracing Authority and England Athletics also start using ipadio.  Many educators such as Scotland’s College’s begin to use ipadio for language classes in particular.  Virgin Media become the first corporate client, followed by HomeServe.  ipadio move to offices in Farringdon.  Boris Johnson became one of the first celebrity users.</p>\n\n<p>2011: New clients include Grant Thornton, Ladbrokes, London Midland, an International Pharmaceutical that’s too private for us to name them but gosh they’re big, The Football Association, Guinness.  Video added to ipadio’s broadcasting capabilities.  Explorers such as Mark Wood, Jordan Romero, Felicity Ashton and Sara Outen join the ipadians as ipadio gets used from the South Pole, North Pole and top of Everest.</p>\n\n<p>2012: Further clients include NHS and Steria, JustGiving, LOCOG, Thames Water, Sony, O2 Health, United Utilities, Calibre, London 2012 and SSP UK.  Android app with video added to previous audio and phone broadcasting features. </p>\n\n<p>2013: This year ipadio will get our registration for ISO/IEC 27001 for Information Security Management, as we see our flagship ContactEngine embraced by a number of existing and new blue-chip clients to allow them to interact more effectively with their millions of consumers.  New HD video sharing possibilities are being investigated, and we are expanding our team rapidly into new offices overlooking Smithfield Market.</p>\n\n<p>Funding ipadio was incubated by 3rd Sector digital communication specialists www.nemisys.uk.com, a company which ipadio’s directors also founded.   In January 2011, ipadio secured a £1m investment from the London Business Angels one of Europe&#8217;s leading investment networks, the second half of which was accessed in 2013.</p>\n\n<p>Awards:\nWinner: Most Innovative Technology of 2009 by eConsultancy \nWinner: Best Mobile Investment of 2011 by the British Business Angels Association \nWinner: Innovation in Rich Media and Video 2012 by eConsultancy</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,55],"assets/images/resized/0005/1719/51719v1-max-150x150.png"],[[183,68],"assets/images/resized/0005/1719/51719v1-max-250x250.png"],[[183,68],"assets/images/resized/0005/1719/51719v1-max-450x450.png"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chairman","person":{"first_name":"Philip","last_name":"Kimberly","permalink":"philip-kimberly"}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder and CEO","person":{"first_name":"Mark","last_name":"Smith","permalink":"mark-smith-2"}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder and Chief Operating Officer","person":{"first_name":"Andy","last_name":"Ayers","permalink":"andy-ayers"}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Co-Founder and Business Development Director","person":{"first_name":"Giles","last_name":"Bryan","permalink":"giles-bryan"}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Finance Director","person":{"first_name":"Anthony","last_name":"Francis","permalink":"anthony-francis-2"}},{"is_past":true,"title":"","person":{"first_name":"John","last_name":"Duffy","permalink":"john-duffy"}},{"is_past":true,"title":"Non-exec Director","person":{"first_name":"Mike","last_name":"Brace","permalink":"mike-brace"}}],"competitions":[{"competitor":{"name":"AudioBoo","permalink":"audioboo"}},{"competitor":{"name":"Tweetmic","permalink":"tweetmic"}}],"providerships":[],"total_money_raised":"$1.6M","funding_rounds":[{"id":21316,"round_code":"unattributed","source_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2011/02/07/ipadio-secures-1-6m-to-take-phone-to-web-audio-into-businesses/","source_description":"ipadio Secures $1.6m To Take Phone-To-Web Audio Into Businesses","raised_amount":1600000,"raised_currency_code":"USD","funded_year":2011,"funded_month":2,"funded_day":7,"investments":[]}],"investments":[],"acquisition":null,"acquisitions":[],"offices":[{"description":"","address1":"96 Farringdon Road","address2":"","zip_code":"EC1R 3EA","city":"London","state_code":null,"country_code":"GBR","latitude":51.8205815,"longitude":0.0118608}],"milestones":[],"ipo":null,"video_embeds":[],"screenshots":[{"available_sizes":[[[150,148],"assets/images/resized/0004/8831/48831v2-max-150x150.jpg"],[[250,246],"assets/images/resized/0004/8831/48831v2-max-250x250.jpg"],[[450,444],"assets/images/resized/0004/8831/48831v2-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null}],"external_links":[{"external_url":"http://joedale.typepad.com/integrating_ict_into_the_/2009/05/phlogging-the-french-trip-with-ipadio.html","title":"Classroom use"},{"external_url":"http://blogs.journalism.co.uk/editors/tag/ipadio/","title":"Journalists use"},{"external_url":"http://homepage.mac.com/guyclapperton/Personalpage/Socialnetworkingblog/files/5cc7eb7fde2695e263d97f866b289fdc-22.html","title":"Blogging tool"},{"external_url":"http://www.stuartbruce.biz/2009/06/sony-ericsson-announces-new-greenheart-strategy-in-live-kyte-webcast-today-1.html","title":"For publicity (PR)"},{"external_url":"http://current.com/items/90039324_paralympic-hero-joins-web-social-media-outfit.htm","title":"Current TV introduces director"},{"external_url":"http://clubs.rfu.com/CLUBS/portals/RFUIT3PeaksChallengePage/","title":"Sport and fundraising"},{"external_url":"http://www.timetogetequal.org.uk/news.asp?itemid=637&itemTitle=Great+British+Bus+Tour&section=25&sectionTitle=News","title":"Campaigning"}],"partners":[],"opening_date":{"$date":"2015-05-31T18:28:56.184Z"}}

When the program concluded in 1996 at the National Renewable Energy Lab in Golden, Colorado, the final program close-out report concluded that, in spite of many impressive accomplishments â€” especially in the biological sciences â€” â€œthe high cost of algae production remains an obstacleâ€. The key barriers in 1996 were:\nLow cost of conventional fuel (diesel prices were hovering around $1.10 per gallon).\nNo monetary value for carbon mitigation capability of biodiesel.\nHigher than expected cost of the production system.\nLower than expected productivity of outdoor open pond system.\nA decade later, the world is different: Diesel is selling decisively at or above the $3.50 mark; the monetization of carbon is well underway in Europe with the US expected to follow soon; and a robust market for renewable biofuels had emerged.</p>\n\n<p>In April 2006, the algae-based biodiesel gauntlet was taken up by a proven team of engineers and entrepreneurs armed with a breakthrough design for a closed algae growth system that is cost competitive with open systems. With initial funding in hand, Solix Biofuels came on stage, ready to turn the promise of research into commercial reality.</p>\n\n<p>By August 2006 a first generation prototype had been built, tested, and analyzed, and a second generation prototype was launched. And the adventure is just beginning.</p>","image":{"available_sizes":[[[150,73],"assets/images/resized/0004/9041/49041v1-max-150x150.jpg"],[[224,110],"assets/images/resized/0004/9041/49041v1-max-250x250.jpg"],[[224,110],"assets/images/resized/0004/9041/49041v1-max-450x450.jpg"]],"attribution":null},"products":[],"relationships":[{"is_past":false,"title":"Chief Operating Officer","person":{"first_name":"Richard","last_name":"Schoonover","permalink":"richard-schoonover"}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Executive Vice President Business Development","person":{"first_name":"James","last_name":"Tuan","permalink":"james-tuan"}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Vice President Engineering","person":{"first_name":"Bryan","last_name":"McCarty","permalink":"bryan-mccarty"}},{"is_past":false,"title":"Board of Directors","person":{"first_name":"Brian","last_name":"L.

A successful mixture of knowledge and expertise. No matter how diverse the backgrounds of the founders and investors, they shared the same passion: innovation, with intelligent and effective communication as the objective.</p>\n\n<p>That objective took shape in Luma, an on-demand marketing platform for field and channel sales. It enables medium and large companies such as Toyota, Mercedes-Benz, Coca-Cola, Bacardi, P&amp;V and others to create personalized marketing materials on-demand, which helps save money and drive sales. Using this solution, companies offer their sales and marketing organizations better support, enhance their marketing flexibility and improve the effectiveness of their campaigns, while still guaranteeing brand consistency. With Luma, marketing capitalizes fully on the sales organization&#8217;s objectives.</p>\n\n<p>Because the needs to which Luma answers are not market or sector-related, companies from a variety of sectors have already implemented Luma successfully. Not only does Luma score well among users, but the platform has also garnered prestigious nominations and awards.</p>\n\n<p>The Luma platformâ€™s capabilities reflect attributes of Marketing Resource Management, Enterprise 2.0 and Ecommerce 2.0. As the company continues to develop new capabilities, it pushes its technology further into these three areas.</p>\n\n<p>Today, Luma International has offices in Antwerp (Belgium), Rotterdam (The Netherlands), Paris (France) and Redwood Shores, CA (USA).
